## Linked List Zip
- By Sowmya Billakanti
- Created a linked list and tests

## Challenge
Write a function called zipLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.


## Aproach & Efficiency
My approach was to start with the code and then write the tests.

## Resources
- Took my used husband's help. 

## API
insert- to add a new node
