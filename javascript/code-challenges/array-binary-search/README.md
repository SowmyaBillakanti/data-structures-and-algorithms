### Array Binary Search
Binary Search Code challenge

### Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

### Approach & Efficiency
Used Math.floor to get the Middle Index of the array, used while loop to iterate and when it equals the value, it returns.
